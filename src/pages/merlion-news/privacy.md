# Merlion News Privacy Policy

Last Revised & Effective Date: Jan 20th, 2025.

## Introduction

Merlion News is an free to use, non opensource app, with limited features, targeting mainly at news readers such as myself. I was disturbed by the fact that we had individual apps for individual news source and one telegram channel, i wanted to make something like Reddit where a single platform with information from everywhere.

## What information do i collect and store?

Nothing. Unless you opt in for crash data report which will be collected automatically upon app crash for bug fixing. I don't want to spend the money on extra storage you see.

## What information is collected?

Other than when fetching information that your IP address, device type, other various data about the device you are using, nothing else really.

## How is history and bookmark saved then?

It is saved on your own iCloud account. if not then its on your own personal device which will be deleted when app is removed.

## Changes to this policy

I might change this from time to time depends on the feature being added. Will update via App Store and Play Store too.
