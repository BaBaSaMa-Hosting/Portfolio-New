# TravelSG Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how TravelSG ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").
Last Revised & Effective Date: Sept. 8, 2025.

## Introduction

TravelSG is an free with optional subscription model app, non opensource. with limited features, targeting at commoners like me who takes the bus near daily. I find the exising bus apps lacking back in 2019 and decided to build one with apple features.

## What information do i collect and store?

### Pro Subscription

iOS will collect data internally on your usage such as timing, bus stop you click into, bus stop you stop scrolling at, upcoming bus map, starting live activity on certain bus. And taking in of such data, it will use built in algorithm to guess whether you want to see certain bus at certain time and start live activity of certain bus at certain time, etc...

also live activity can opt in for infinite upcoming bus instead of ending when the latest bus has arrived at the bus stop.

### Live Activity - iOS

iOS will start the live activity in app and will generate out this push token which will be uploaded to my server for push update on bus timings. I will keep the push token for as long as the live activity is active for. upon terminating the live activity, and app is running in either foreground and background, the live activity push token will be remove from my server. if live activity is being remotely terminated by my server, it will automatically remove any information related to it.

### Live Activity - watchOS

iOS will generate this push to start token in app, which is stored in your own personal iCloud, which if wanted to start live activity from watchOS, will upload this push to start token to my server to kick start an remote start live activity with a push notification. Then iOS will start in background and generate out this new push token for live activity update.

## How does Crash Report works?

upon TravelSG app crash, information on where did the app has crashed is being logged and uploaded to my server for further investigation without you needing to submit a personal report. It is default turned off.

## Changes to this policy

I might change this from time to time depends on the feature being added. Will update via App Store too.
